This is the number system we currently use to represent numbers within mathematical equations.

These are all of the numbers we use:
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Using the number place system we can count up like a counting clicker.

Hundreds Place | Tens Place | Units Place

9+1 = 10
10+90 = 100
Once the units place > 9 we reset the units place to 0 and increment the tens place.
