Humans wanted to build a tool to help with thinking
Any "thinking machine" would need:
- Input
- Store information
- Process it
- Output

## Sand Tray
Portable box filled with a thin layer of sand that the user would write on.
Later they would start to place pebbles in the sand as counters.
## Early Abacus

## Abacus

Latin for *sand tray*
The first tool that helped humans with thinking
### Earthly beads
- Worth 1 bead
- Once the earthly beads are all touching the bar and you want to add more, you un-rack the earthly beads for 1 heavenly bead
### Heavenly Beads
- The beads that are above the bar, normally a smaller count of them
- Worth 5 beads
### Reckoning bar
- Wooden bar stretching long ways across the abacus
- If a bead is slid towards the bar it is counted
- Every set of 3 is the comma
- Each bar is a number place 1s>10s>100s>1,000s...

## Pascaline

- Was able to do addition and subtraction using addition tricks
## Leibniz's Step Reckoner
![[Pasted image 20230916125225.png]]
-Was able to calculate addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
## Babbage Engine

- This would read inputs from punch cards and mechanically output without need for interference from a user
- Ada Lovelace developed memory storage, loops, and algorithms to solve mathematical problems designed for the machine
- Invented because mathematics had a lot of patterns that repeated, if exploitable a machine could easily calculate for a human using basic rules.
## Hollerith Tabulating Machine
![[Pasted image 20230916130434.png]]
- Takes inputs in form of a punch card
- Feed that card in, a circuit would connect through wherever there were holes.
## Turing Machine
- A theorized idea that you could make a machine that could be altered to handle any task you gave it
- All previous machines were restricted to calculating either inputed numbers for arithmetic or based on punchcards with predetermined placements for circuits connection.
- What if you could display any result you wanted with any input and program the process yourself whenever you wanted?

## Konrad Zuse's Programmable Computer
![[Pasted image 20230916131353.png]]
- Using Boolean logic you could program this machine that read punchcard tape to execute commands.
- First Machine that could store data
- First Commercial computer
# Vacuum Tubes
- This began the event of modern computing
- Unlike the relays from early computers, these tubes were faster, used less power, and reliable.
- Took up a lot of space
- Burned out quickly
- Expensive to power
## The ABC
- A vacuum tube computer that was purely digital, but only solved specific algorithms
## The Colossus
- Fully programmable and digital computer

# Transistors
- 1950s small cheap and not expensive to power
# RAM (Random Access Memory)
- Used to store small amounts of data
- Volatile Memory, only stores data while powered
- Fast storage
- Basically the "working memory"
# Integrated Circuit
- Packing a bunch of transistors together
# Floppy Disc
- Able to store long term data in a portable format
