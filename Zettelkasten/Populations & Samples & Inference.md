## Population
- An overall group we are interested in.
- Example: All prisoners within a specific country
## Samples
- A subset of an entire population, because we cannot get data on the entire population really.
- Example: the amount of people within the test
## Parameters
- A numeric characteristic pertaining to a population, which's value is unknown so we try to estimate it.
## Statistic
- Any number you calculate using data we often use statistics to estimate values.
## Inference
- We draw an inference to the population from which was sample. We use the sample to generalize to the population.
## Small sample size
- Each person's result could throw the average out of wack
