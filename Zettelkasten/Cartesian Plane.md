A concept popularized by [[Rene Descartes]] in which a grid is defined by two perpendicular number lines, the [[X-axis]] which is horizontal and the [[Y-axis]] which is vertical. Using this grid we can place any ordered pair upon it.

The cartesian plane quadrants are numbered with roman numerals from 1 to 4 starting in the top right then counting up counter clockwise.
