## Why is this important?
- "f(x) becomes arbitrarily close to L" or "X approaches C"
- We are giving a rigorous mathematical explanation for an intuitive idea.
- $f(x)=x^2$
- We know that every X has a Y
- But if theres a hole in that function we cannot plug in an X and get a Y
- Formula states that we can give a range AROUND that missing point
- get a range of result values
## Terms
### Delta - $\delta$ 
Represents a small number, the change of the slope of the line
### Epsilon - $\epsilon$ 
Represents a small number

## Formal Definition
$\lim f(x)=L$
$x\rightarrow c$

$f(x)$ is the function
$L$ is the limit
$x$ is the points on the function
$c$ is the point we approach
