*Measured by the count of operations the algorithm must perform rather than time*

## Types of time complexity
### Constant - O(1)
*These operation's speed will not be effected by the input*
- Mathematical operations
- Comparisons
- Assignment of variables
- Reading or writing a given index in an array
- Assigning a variable to a string is constant when assigning to [[Pointer]] or reference
### Linear - O(n)
*Input count directly effects operations completed*
### Logarithmic time - O(log n)
*Reduces the size of the input data in each step*
### Quadratic - O(n^2)
### Cubic time - O(n^3)
### Recursive Function
- Base case: first check to see if the code should execute.
