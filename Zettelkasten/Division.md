#### Definition
A mathematical operation that takes in two arguments, breaking ***a*** into a number of smaller numbers of equal size equal to ***b***. The result is the amount of times ***b*** can fit into **a**.

#### Properties
Division is not commutative, meaning that the placement of terms around the symbol matters **a** must come before the $\div$.

Division is not associative, meaning that the order matters and cannot be changed you must go left to right.

#### Notation
a $\div$ b =
a / b = 

#### Copy dot Flip method
$\frac{\frac{1}{2}}{\frac{2}{1}}=\frac{1}{2}/\frac{2}{1}=\frac{1}{2}*\frac{1}{2}$ 

a / b = result
a is the dividend 
b is the divisor 
result is the quotient
