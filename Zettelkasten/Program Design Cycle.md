[[Object Oriented Design]]
Its about breaking a problem down and implementing an automated solution. These solutions are language agnostic. 

People often don't understand why people would use older languages. But thats because older code has been running successfully for years, so you might as well build off of that stable foundation.

All programs need maintenance if people are regularly using it.
During corona virus people were trying to apply for unemployment, there were too many people accessing the server so instead of rewriting the code for efficiency they simply restricted who could go onto the site at a given day.

## Problem Statement
How complex of a language do you want to use?
What device will this program run on?
Does it need to be future proof?
## Algorithms & data structures


## Testing
