This is an aspect of transforms that can effect a [[Sinusoidal wave]] when [[Trig Equation Transforms.canvas|Trig Equation Transforms Canvas]].

The distance along the [[X-axis]] until a wave makes a complete cycle and returns back to its starting position on the [[Y-axis]].

To find the Period of [[Trigonometric Functions]]
[[Period]]  = $\frac {2\pi} {Frequency}$
