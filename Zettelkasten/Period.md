This is an aspect of transforms that can effect a [[Sinusoidal wave]] when [[Trig Equation Transforms.canvas|Trig Equation Transforms Canvas]].

The distance along the x-axis until a wave makes a complete cycle and returns back to its starting position on the y-axis.

To find the Period of [[Trigonometric Functions]]
[[Period]]  = $\frac {2\pi} {Frequency}$
