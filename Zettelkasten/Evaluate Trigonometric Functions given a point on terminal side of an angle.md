When given a point it will be located in one of the quadrants in the [[Cartesian Plane]] affecting the sides of the [[Triangle]].

## Example
Given a point (-8,15) on the terminal side of an angle $\theta$ drawn in standard position, line is drawn at $0\degree$. Find the [[Trigonometric Functions]] of $\theta$

The point will be placed into quadrant 2
Triangle
Opposite Length: 15
Adjacent Length: -8
[[Hypotenuse]]: $(-8)^2+15^2=x^2=17$  *see [[Right Triangle Trigonometry]]*

With these values we can plug the sides into each of out [[Trigonometric Functions]]
