Take 3 functions 2 surrounding the one you want to find
$g(x)<f(x)<h(x)$

Take their limits, as long as the surrounding limits are equal
$lim$ $g(x) = lim$ $h(x) = L$
$x\rightarrow a$         $x\rightarrow a$

Then the limit of the desired function MUST be the same
$lim$ $f(x) = L$
$x\rightarrow a$
