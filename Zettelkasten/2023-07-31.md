I have my final next week for Pre-Calc and I'm trying really hard to study for 100% because that would be absolutely insane. I talked to Stephen about our test scores and I proudly boasted a 91.5% the highest score I've gotten on a test in Pre Calc so far, and he shot back with 99.5% THATS INSANE. He got like half of one thing wrong. Bro I studied so hard it's insane and I can't seem to get there. I know I have a learning disability and honestly I like having to work hard because I love learning and doing hard stuff. But I'm still trying to find the methods of learning that my brain will give me super powers with. I'm starting to think there's nothing like that. And I'm just cursed to have to spend more time on studying and less time doing fun stuff. I'm a little freak nerd though so I do love studying. I stayed up till 3 last night studying math and using Obsidian Notes because the formatting is super cool. I also went to the smash grind session and played for about an hour, I've definitely gotten better but there's a lot I still need to practice.
