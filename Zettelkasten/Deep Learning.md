Deep learning is an extrapolation of machine learning which is used to create programs without need for explicit coding for results.

Deep learning is extracting data from patterns using neural networks

Key advances that have occurred recently 
-We have more data collected than ever before
-Require a lot of compute which we now have, due to hardware advancements
-Software advancements making it easier than ever before

Single neuron is a perceptron

-Perceptrons x weight
-Perceptron x weight + otherPerceptions x theirWeights = sumNode
-SumNode is then fed through the non linearity node, example: sigmoid function
-Finally it produces an output
