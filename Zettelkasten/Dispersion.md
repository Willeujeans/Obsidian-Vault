How spread out is data, how varied is data?

{20 iPhone's weight}         {20 bread's weight}       {20 people's weight}
<-Less Dispersed-----------------------------------More Dispersed->
## Measures of dispersion
### Range
- Max-Min, basically finding out how far apart the numbers are from each other
### IQR
- Inter quartile range
- the distance between quartiles IQR = Q3-Q1
### Sample Variance
- Uses all the data points
- More sensitive to outliers 
- Denoted as $S^2$
- Calculate sum of squared deviations
- Deviation is the difference between one data point and the mean.
- $Deviation^2$
- Then add all of those up

n-1 is sample size -1
### Standard Deviation
- It is the square root of variance
- Its basically an average amount of deviation
- In JMP go to analyze > distribution > y columns
